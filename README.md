# Album-Review
A simple team project for the 2022 SheHacks Workshop. We were given a few hours to create a simple website reviewing an album
from our favorite singer using HTML and CSS, while incorporating certain style elements and features such as links to singer's Spotify profile. We added extra elements to make it more interesting such as a comment section.
